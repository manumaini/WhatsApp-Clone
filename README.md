# WhatsApp-Clone
hello everyone !!
Ever since a started learning android development i wanted to build an app just like whatsApp . Well why not !? Here I'm sharing my progress on the whatsapp clone i have been working on.
At this stage the app enables the users to chat , upload status , pick and store media in local device,search global contacts, View Status, update profile related information, login with mobile number (With phone number verification).

Technologies used:
Firebase Firestore: For Storing User's information like name, description ,Thumbnail-Url etc.
Firebase RealtimeDatabase: For storing chats and status .
Firebase Storage: For Storing media.
Firebase Authentication: For user login and registration.
CameraX: For Accessing Device's Camera .
MVP Architecture .

Happy Coding...
